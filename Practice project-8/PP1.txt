To configure JSP with Eclipse and create a simple JSP page, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up Eclipse IDE
1. Download and install Eclipse IDE from the official website.
2. Launch Eclipse and create a new Java project.

Step 2: Configure Apache Tomcat server
1. Download Apache Tomcat server from the official website (make sure to choose the appropriate version compatible with your Eclipse IDE).
2. Extract the downloaded Tomcat server archive to a desired location on your computer.
3. In Eclipse, go to the "Servers" view (Window -> Show View -> Servers).
4. Right-click in the Servers view and select "New" -> "Server".
5. Select "Apache" -> "Tomcat" as the server type, and click "Next".
6. Choose the Tomcat installation directory by clicking the "Browse" button and selecting the extracted Tomcat folder.
7. Click "Finish" to add the Tomcat server to Eclipse.

Step 3: Create a Dynamic Web Project
1. In Eclipse, right-click on your project in the Project Explorer and select "New" -> "Dynamic Web Project".
2. Provide a project name and click "Next".
3. Select the target runtime as the Apache Tomcat server you configured in the previous step.
4. Keep the default settings for the configuration and click "Finish".

Step 4: Create a JSP page
1. Inside the WebContent directory of your project, create a new file with a .jsp extension (e.g., "index.jsp").
2. Open the JSP file and write your desired HTML and JSP code. For example:

```jsp
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple JSP Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My JSP Page</h1>
    <p>Current date and time: <%= new java.util.Date() %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

Step 5: Run the project on the Tomcat server
1. In Eclipse, right-click on your project and select "Run As" -> "Run on Server".
2. Choose the configured Tomcat server and click "Finish".
3. Eclipse will start the Tomcat server and deploy your web application.
4. The JSP page will be accessible at the URL provided by the Tomcat server (usually http://localhost:8080/your-project-name/index.jsp).

That's it! You have configured JSP with Eclipse and created a simple JSP page. You can now continue developing your web application using JSP and deploy it on the Tomcat server for testing and execution.
